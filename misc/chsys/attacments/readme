The template dir is too large to include, so I'll give you the output of `version` command here

```
15.0-RELEASE
Candidates for chsys:
/usr/local/freebsd-bases/14.3
/usr/local/freebsd-bases/15.0
/usr/local/freebsd-bases/13.5
```

As for `freebsd-bases`, they are really the content of official base.txz from freebsd, nothing special

And this is all you need. You should be able to solve it without connecting the server. GL HF

One more thing to notice, resource limit at spawn.sh may change on server, depends on number of connections
